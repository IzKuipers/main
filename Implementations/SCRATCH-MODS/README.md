# How To Import it
Importing Rotur is quite simple in modern Scratch Mods. This guide is specifically for *Turbowarp*, but should work for other mods of itself.
The Button is the one in the bottom corner, as shown below.

After this you will be presented with a Menu, listing lots of extensions. You need one that looks something like this:

The button may have this image, but generally, it needs to allow you to import from **text**.

Then, you enter the code, insure that **Unsandboxed** is _**Enabled!**_, and hit import. You now have the Rotur Extension Imported!
